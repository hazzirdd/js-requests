    //PROBLEM 11

    You are going to add the ability to POST to the server. You'll need to create a small form and write a function that makes a post request. Then you'll attach that function to the submit event on the form. We'll be creating a list of foods. 

    In the index.html file inside of the client folder, create a form with one text input field and a button. The input field should have a placeholder that tells the user to enter a food. And the button should indicate that it will add food into a list. 

    In this file (script.js), create a function called createFood. 
    
    Inside the function, select the input you just created in the HTML and save it to a variable called foodInput. 
    
    Next, create an object called body inside the function. It should have one key-value pair. The key should be newFood (make sure to match the case and spelling exactly) and the value should be the value of the food input. 

    Now make an axios post request to /food. Inside the parentheses where you passed the URL in, pass in body as the second argument. 

    Use a .then to handle the promise returned from the axios call. Pass a callback function to the .then. Inside that callback, console log the res.data. 

    Based on what we did earlier to display this type of data, write code that will display the response in your HTML document.
